        <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
        <p>My work experience in this field is only beginning. I have little to show for now but I have worked on some other 
            projects using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JS</strong>. Some big projects I have worked 
            on are shown below, I have also worked on many smaller projects while following along with udemy courses.

                <h4>Amazingly Strange</h4>
                <p>The website is still yet to be posted but I had run into many challenges making this website including properly 
                    keeping the words and images all positioned correctly when the screen is resized. One very cool thing I 
                    accomplished during this project was the slideshow gallery and how the images rotate in a circle as you're on 
                    the page. For now there is only placeholder page for this website that you can still check at 
                    <a href="https://www.amazinglystrange.com/">Amazingly Strange</a>.

                <h4>Drawing App</h4>
                <p>This app has not been published but I hope that there is some what to be able and modify it so that I could possibly 
                    become some type of fun game or app in the future. But for now this is only a little project that I accomplished by 
                    following a tutorial that you can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxJGK8uckYE">HERE</a>.

            <li>
                <h4>Floating Text Project</h4>
                <p>This project was super fun to do and I learned a bit of CSS whille doing it especially with transforming objects over the
                     y-axis as well as radial gradients. The text when hovered over will actually move up and then move down again when the 
                     cursor is no longer over it. I find this concept relaxing for some odd reason and this website could honestly be great 
                     for a makeup brand I believe.</p>
